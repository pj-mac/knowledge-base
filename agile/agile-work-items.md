# Epics, Stories, Tasks, Acceptance Criteria

The purpose of this page is to document a summary of the following definitions which will be related to continuously through the Agile Define/Deliver process:

- [Epics](#epics)
- [User Stories](#user-stories)
- [Tasks](#tasks)
- [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)

## Epics

An agile epic is a body of work that can be broken down into specific tasks (called “stories,” or “user stories”) based on the needs/requests of customers or end users.

Epics are a helpful way to organize your work and to create a hierarchy. The idea is to break work down into shippable pieces, so that large projects can actually get done, and you can continue to ship value to your customers on a regular basis. Epics help teams break their work down, while continuing to work towards a bigger goal.

Epics are almost always delivered over a set of sprints. As a team learns more about an epic through development and customer feedback, user stories will be added and removed as necessary.

## User Stories

A user story is derived from an epic in the agile framework. It’s an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective.

The purpose of a user story is articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer, whether that be internal or external.  User stories are a few sentences in simple language that outline the desired outcome. They don't go into detail. Requirements are added later, once agreed upon by the team.

Stories fit neatly into agile frameworks like scrum and kanban. In scrum, user stories are added to sprints and “burned down” over the duration of the sprint. Kanban teams pull user stories into their backlog and run them through their workflow. It’s this work on user stories that help scrum teams get better at estimation and sprint planning, leading to more accurate forecasting and greater agility.

## Tasks

Tasks are an output of user stories which can be identified either ahead of a particular sprint or during sprint planning.

While epics and user stories traditionally follow the same format (As a, I want to, So that), tasks by their very nature, focus on the specifics (functional or non-functional) required in order to complete a particular user story.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are a formal list that fully enumerates user requirements and all the product scenarios put into the account. Acceptance criteria plainly describe conditions under which the user requirements are desired, thus getting rid of any uncertainty within the team and expectations are aligned .

In short, acceptance criteria list is nothing more than a DoD that is specific to every user story. While the DoD usually applies to all items in the backlog, Acceptance Criteria are applicable to a specific user story. In order to complete the story, both the DoD and acceptance criteria must be met

The acceptance criteria enable the development team to identify the user story which they can use as a reference of whether the product functionality works as required. Since the user story is the primary objective of the software development process, the team can use it to assess the progress and the product.
