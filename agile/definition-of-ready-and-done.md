# Definition of Ready

The scrum team can achieve the definition of done for the story in a single sprint (with a preference of within a couple of days)

- The team has a shared understanding of the story
- The story has been to a team refinement session
- The story has been estimated by the team
- External services and dependencies are available to develop and test against (or will be available within sprint)
- The acceptance criteria is clearly defined
- The team has an understanding of how to automate testing for this story
- All artifacts for the story are available
- Designs / style guides (attached to the work item, or will be at the point of development)
- UX / user flow (attached to the work item)
- Technical architecture is available

**INVEST** principles are used to ensure items are ready to be brought into a sprint. An item can't be brought in without satisfying all of these

- **I**ndependent - of all other tasks. If dependency exists, these must be split out
- **N**egotiable - not a specific contract for features
- **V**aluable - provides business value
- **E**stimable - if an item isn't estimable, it needs to be split or refined until it becomes estimable with at most 8 story points
- **S**mall - must be completed in one sprint
- **T**estable - in principle (a test strategy doesn't need to exist) but it must have clear AC and hypothesis to test


The INVEST principles should ensure:

- Requirements are clearly defined but do not specify implementation
- Business value can be delivered in one sprint
- Tech feasibility
- QA and Acceptance Criteria are clearly defined

# Definition of Done

At what point is a story considered complete?

- All tasks for a story have been completed
- All acceptance criteria for a story have been met
- Unit tests are written and passed, where appropriate
- Code has been peer reviewed, where appropriate
- Code has been merged and all tests have passed
- All appropriate testing (including functional and non-functional, as needed) has been created and excused, with applicable screenshots/other artifacts captured and uploaded to Azure DevOps/TestRail.
- The functional and non-functional tests have been automated, where appropriate
- Functional and Technical Documentation has been provided as needed
- Code has been released and deployed to minimum integration environment
- Real content is available
- Story signed off/accepted by the Product Owner and Product Manager
- We as a team are proud of this and happy for our customers to use it
